# LSTM Music Generation

## Overview
This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to generate original MIDI compositions autonomously. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model learns sequential patterns from a dataset of MIDI files and generates new musical sequences. 

## Features
- Data preprocessing: Extracts musical notes and chords from MIDI files.
- LSTM model architecture: Design includes multiple LSTM layers and dropout regularization.
- Music generation: Generates original compositions using the trained LSTM model.

## Installation
1. Install dependencies

## Usage
1. Prepare MIDI dataset
2. Preprocess data
3. Train the LSTM model
4. Generate music
